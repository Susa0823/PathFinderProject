          <p class="margin-bottom-24px-3">
            Sometimes, you just cannot make any progress without some proper
            relaxation. Even when one diverts their minds from their primary
            focus, it does not mean the brain has stopped ticking; some things
            take time to process and engaging in some trivial gaming
            surprisingly proves to be one of the best things you can do. Before
            you know it while you are breaking blocks or strategizing over a
            game of tic tac toe, the answer you are looking for will pop up
            right before you, elevating your spirits and boosting your
            productivity because now you are aware of what needs to done to move
            forward.

          Many parents are wary of video games and don&#x27;t want them in the
          home for fear that they would negatively affect their kids&#x27;
          academic achievement. However, playing video games can enhance your
          focus, creativity, memory, language skills, and teamwork.
        </p>
        <h5>THE KEYS TO GAME-BASED LEARNING</h5>
        <p>
          With game-based learning, videogames have benefited education as well.
          This teaching strategy imparts knowledge to pupils by utilizing
          advantageous elements of videogames. It is founded on three crucial
          elements:It gives learning new life by turning it into an entertaining
          game without tedious lessons. Information is assimilated and retained
          by students practically subconsciously.<br />It increases motivation
          because the story&#x27;s main characters—students—are rewarded for
          their performance with medals, additional lives, bonuses, etc. Their
          interest in learning is piqued and maintained by this.<br />It
          provides opportunities for practice so that students can use what they
          learn without putting themselves in risk. For instance, the main focus
          of flying and navigation simulators is this.
        </p>
        <h5>BENEFITS OF PLAYING VIDEO GAMES:</h5>
        <p>
          Numerous studies have been conducted on the effects of video games on
          society. For instance, a study defining how much time kids should
          spend playing video games was published in the journal Paediatrics in
          2014 by Andrew Przybylski, a psychologist at the Internet Institute at
          Oxford University. He came to the conclusion that people who played
          for less than an hour had greater emotional stability, whereas those
          who played for about three hours every day displayed social issues.
          So, when it comes to video games, moderation is crucial because there
          are other advantages outside only enhancing learning. Let&#x27;s
          examine a few of them:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>They accelerate reaction times.</strong><br />By presenting
          challenges that must be solved in a specific amount of time,
          researchers at Rochester University have discovered that
          troubleshooting abilities are improved. They promote cooperation.<br />The
          Institute for the Future (IFTF), a California-based organization,
          claims that multiplayer games encourage problem-solving teamwork.
          <br /><br /><strong
            >They increase imagination, concentration, and visual
            memory.</strong
          ><br />According to research from the University of California, these
          abilities are stimulated by setting objectives that call for focus,
          creativity, and the ability to recall specifics. <br /><strong
            ><br />They enhance leadership and strategy.</strong
          ><br />According to research from Pittsburgh University, playing video
          games puts the player in charge and helps them develop their capacity
          for negotiation, player interaction, and decision-making.<br /><br /><strong
            >Enhances critical thinking.</strong
          ><br />Languages are taught.Helsinki University discovered that they
          are helpful for picking up new languages through on-screen
          instructions, player conversations, or the story&#x27;s narration.
          critically analyzing an essay from the Monterrey Institute of
          Technology highlighted the moral, intellectual, and social foundations
          of these games as well as how they might make players think and
          sharpen their critical thinking skills.
